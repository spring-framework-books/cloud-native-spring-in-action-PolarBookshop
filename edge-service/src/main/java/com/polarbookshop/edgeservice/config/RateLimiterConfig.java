bucket to use for each request. By default, it uses the currently authenticated user in
Spring Security. Until we add security to Edge Service, weâ€™ll define a custom Key-
Resolver bean and make it return a constant value (for example, anonymous) so that
all requests will be mapped to the same bucket.
